                <p>Welcome to the Inspirational Women in Tech page! Role models are important for any
                    field, and in the field of technology women have, for centuries, been an influential presence.
                    The work of numerous women through the years has helped to shape the direction and vision of
                    technological advances. This page aims to highlight the achievements of some of these important women,
                    and to encourage others to pursue a career in STEM.

                <h3>Ada Lovelace</h3>
                <p>It would be remiss of any page dedicated to inspirational women in tech not to start with Ada Lovelace.
                    As the child of Lord Byron, she was given extensive tuition in mathematics and science.
                    Through her later friendship with Charles Baggage, she translated a French article on his "Analytical
                    Engine", which resembled a modern computer. Her extensive notes on that project were later used by Alan Turing 
                    as inspiration for his work in the 1940s.
                    <br>
                    You can read more about her life and work <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace"
